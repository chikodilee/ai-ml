## Objective 
To gain experience on the use of Neural Networks and Fuzzy Inference Systems.


Problem 1:
Using a feedforward back-propagation neural network that contains a single hidden layer (with a variable number of hidden nodes each having an activation function of the logistic form), investigate the outcome of the neural network

Problem 2:
Train a MLP network for obtaining the output of the following two-to-one mapping function.
